Section 1.1: Velocity and Tangent Line
    The derivative is how steep the graph of f is at a given x-value, a.
    f'(a) is the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at x = a.
    Formal Definition of the Derivative:
        Given point <em>a</em>, the limit as <em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> in:
        [Img of function here]
        This is equivalently represented by:
        [Img of second function (a+h) representation]
    [Info Regarding use of the equations?]

Section 1.2: Limit of a Function, Infinite Limits, and Asymptotes
    The limit of a function, f(x) is the value that it "approaches" as x "approaches" some value a. 

    The Long Evaluation of a Limit
    Formally, the limit f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L, if we can make f(x) abitrarliy close
    to L by making x sufficiently close to a but not equal to a. 
    For example, we may estimate the value of the limit 
    [insert example limit here]
    by taking values of x closer and closer to [insert a here]
    [insert table here]
    and guess that:

    Limit Laws:
    Under the assumption that the lim f(x) and lim g(x) both exist-
        1. [equation for lim c = c for any constant c and any value a]
        2. [equation for lim x = a for any value a]
        3. [equation for lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim f(x) + lim g(x)]
        4. [equation for lim (f(x) - g(x)) = lim f(x) - lim g(x)]
        5. For any constant c, [equation for lim c * f(x) = c * lim f(x)]
        6. [equation for lim(f(x) * g(x)) = lim f(x) * lim g(x)]
        7. If [equation for lim g(x) â‰   0] then [lim f(x) / g(x) = lim f(x) / lim g(x)]
        8. If n is an integer, then [equation for lim (f(x))^n = (lim f(x))^n]
        9. If n is an integer (and if n is even then [equation for lim f(x) > 0]) then
        [equation for lim (f(x))^(1/n) = (lim f(x))^(1/n)]

    Basic Techniques:
    Direct Substitution Property-
        If the following conditions hold-
        - The function f(x) only uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
        and taking the powers of polynomials
        - x = a is in the domain of f(x)
        then you may evaluate the limit by substitution f(a).
