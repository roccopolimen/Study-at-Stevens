Section 1.1: Velocity and Tangent Line
    The derivative is how steep the graph of f is at a given x-value, a.
    f'(a) is the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at x = a.
    Formal Definition of the Derivative:
        Given point <em>a</em>, the limit as <em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> in:

Section 1.2: Limit of a Function, Infinite Limits, and Asymptotes
    The limit of a function, f(x) is the value that it "approaches" as x "approaches" some value a. 

    The Long Evaluation of a Limit
    Formally, the limit f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L, if we can make f(x) abitrarliy close
    to L by making x sufficiently close to a but not equal to a. 
    For example, we may estimate the value of the limit 
    [insert example limit here]
    by taking values of x closer and closer to [insert a here]
    [insert table here]
    and guess that:

    Limit Laws:
    Under the assumption that the lim f(x) and lim g(x) both exist-
        1. [equation for lim c = c for any constant c and any value a]
        2. [equation for lim x = a for any value a]
        3. [equation for lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim f(x) + lim g(x)]
        4. [equation for lim (f(x) - g(x)) = lim f(x) - lim g(x)]
        5. For any constant c, [equation for lim c * f(x) = c * lim f(x)]
        6. [equation for lim(f(x) * g(x)) = lim f(x) * lim g(x)]
        7. If [equation for lim g(x) â‰   0] then [lim f(x) / g(x) = lim f(x) / lim g(x)]
        8. If n is an integer, then [equation for lim (f(x))^n = (lim f(x))^n]
        9. If n is an integer (and if n is even then [equation for lim f(x) > 0]) then
        [equation for lim (f(x))^(1/n) = (lim f(x))^(1/n)]

    Basic Techniques:
    Direct Substitution Property-
        If the following conditions hold-
        - The function f(x) only uses addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,
        and taking the powers of polynomials
        - x = a is in the domain of f(x)
        then you may evaluate the limit by substitution f(a).

        Canceling the Denominator:
        You may cancel the dominator through simplification and factoring-
        [insert example here]
        Here, the value x = [insert a here] does not exist in the domain of the function f(x), therefore
        you cannot immediately substitute. You may factor the numerator such that
        [insert example w/ factored numerator here]
        and divide by the denominator, resulting in
        [insert simplified example here]
        with which you can immediately substitute [insert a here], giving you
        [insert evaluation of the limit here]

        Rationalizing:
        In the case that you have a square root in the numerator or denominator, for example
        [insert example here]
        in which you are given that the numerator is [insert numerator here], you may multiply both
        the numerator and denominator of the equation by the conjugate of the numerator. Generally, if
        you are given numerator or denominator [equation a + b(c)^1/2], multiply by:
        [insert equation (a - b(c)^1/2)/(a-b(c)^1/2)] or [insert equation (-a + b(c)^1/2)/(-a + b(c)^1/2)]
        So, in our example, you may multiply by [insert conjugate of numerator here]
        [insert full multiplication using conjugate with simplified equation]

    Limits at Infinity:
    General Rules:
    Top-heavy Functions-
    If given the function
    [insert function here]
    where the leading exponent of the top is greater than that of the bottom, making the function top-heavy,
    the limit as x approaches infinity of that function is infinity.
    Bottom-heavy Function-
    If given the function
    [insert function here]
    where the leading exponent of the bottom is greater than that of the top, making the function bottom-heavy,
    the limit as x approaches infinity of that function is 0.
    Neutral Numerator/Denominator-
    If given the function
    [insert function here]
    where the leading exponent of the top and bottom are the same, you may evaluate the limit as x approaches
    infinity as the coefficient of the leading exponent in the numerator divided by that of the denominator.
    If the leading coefficient of either the numerator or denominator is within a square root, the limit as x
    approaches infinity is +/- the leading coefficient of the numerator divded by that of the denominator.

Section 2.1: Critical Points and Local Extrema
	Critical points exist when the first derivative of a function is equal to 0 or it doesn't exist.
	Check the behavior of the function at its critical points to determine if the critical points are points of local extrema - points where f(x) reaches its maximum or minimum. 

	If the function goes from increasing to decreasing at the critical point, the function has a maximum there.
	If the function goes from decreasing to increasing at the critical point, the function has a minimum there.

Section 2.2: Curve Sketching
	1. Determine the vertical asymptotes
	2. Determine the horizontal asymptotes
	3. Find the critical points of the function by using the 1st derivative.
	4. Find the intervals of increasing/decreasing and any max/min.
	5. Find any inflection points by using the 2nd derivative.
	6. Find the intervals of concave up and concave down.

	Based on all the information, sketch an approximation of the curve.

Section 2.3: Global Extrema
	Global extrema is the overall max and min of a function. Some functions may have both but others may not have either so it depends.
	To find the global extrema, you proceed with how you would do it with local extrema, but here you have to evaluate the values, to determine what the overall max/min is.
	If the function is defined within an interval, you also have to evaluate the endpoints of the interval. 

Section 2.4: Optimization
	For optimization, two equations are needed to solve the problem. 
		1. The equation that you have information for that you can use to define one variable in terms of another.
		2. The equation that you are trying to optimize.

	Once you use the first equation to define one variable in terms of another, substitute that into the second equation so the equation is in terms of one variable. From there, take the derivative, find the critical points, and determine the points of maxima and minima.
