Section 1.1: Velocity and Tangent Line
    The derivative is how steep the graph of f is at a given x-value, a.
    f'(a) is the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at x = a.
    Formal Definition of the Derivative:
        Given point <em>a</em>, the limit as <em>x</em> approaches <em>a</em> in:
        [Img of function here]
        This is equivalently represented by:
        [Img of second function (a+h) representation]
