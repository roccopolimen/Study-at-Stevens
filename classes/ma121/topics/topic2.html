		<h1>Limit of a Function, Infinite Limits, and Asymptotes</h1>
		<p> The limit of a function f(x) is the value that it "approaches" as x "approaches" some value of a.</p>
		<h2> The Long Evaluation of a Limit </h2>
		<p> Formally, the limit f(x), as x approaches a, is equal to L, if we can make f(x) abitrarliy close
    		to L by making x sufficiently close to a but not equal to a.</p>
    	<h2> Limit Laws: </h2>
    	<p> Under the assumption that the lim f(x) and lim g(x) both exist: </p>
    	<ol>
    		<li> [equation for lim c = c for any constant c and any value a] </li>
    		<li> [equation for lim x = a for any value a] </li>
    		<li> [equation for lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim f(x) + lim g(x)] </li>
    	</ol>
