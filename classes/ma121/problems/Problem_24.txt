Problem:
For f(x) = (x^2)/(x^2+3):
- Find vertical and horizontal asymptotes of f(x), if any
- Find all critical numbers
- Find the intervals where f(x) is increasing, where it is decreasing,
and specify local extrema
- Find the intervals where f(x) is concave up and/or concave down,
and specify points of inflection

Answer:
Vertical Asymptotes: N/A
Horizontal Asymptotes: y = 1
Critical Numbers: x = {0}
Decreasing from negative infinity to 0, increasing from 0 to positive infinity,
where 0 is a local minimum.
Concave down from negative infinity to 1 and 1 to positive infinity. Concave up
between -1 and 1, with inflection points at x = {-1,1}.
