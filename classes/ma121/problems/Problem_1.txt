Problem:
For the function f(x) = 3(x+2)^2 and the point P given by x = -3,
Compute the slope of the secant line through the points P and Q given
the values Q = {-3.5,-3.1,-3.01,=3.001,-3.0001}. Use this information to
approximate the slope of the tangent line to f(x) at x = -3. Write the equation
of the tangent line.
