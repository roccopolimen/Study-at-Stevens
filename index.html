                <strong>Welcome to Stevens!</strong><br>
                If you have found this webpage, you are probably a first year student here<br>
                at Stevens Institute of Technology. Starting college is sometimes a difficult<br>
                change for many students. We are here to help. Two classes that are a staple of<br>
                just about every computer science major at Stevens, are Introduction to Computer<br>
                Science (CS 115) and Calculus (MA 121). This website aims to prepare students to<br>
                succeed in all of the topics that will be covered throughout these classes.<br>
                Starting off college with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics<br>
                will make a huge impact during your time here at Stevens as these disciplines<br>
                typically build off of prerequisite knowledge.
